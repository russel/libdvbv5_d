libdvbv5 is a C implemented library creating a higher level API for using DVB on Linux that the Linux DVB
system calls provide. This library provides a [D](http://dlang.org) binding to that library.

[DStep](https://github.com/jacob-carlborg/dstep) is used to handle most of the work, but there is some
manual jiggery pokery.
