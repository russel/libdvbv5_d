# libdvbv5_d â€“ a D binding for the libdvbv5 library

libdvbv5 is a C implemented library creating a higher level API for using DVB on Linux that the Linux DVB
system calls provide. This library provides a D binding to that library.

[DStep](https://github.com/jacob-carlborg/dstep) is used to handle most of the work, but there is some
manual jiggery pokery.

## NB

This is a work in progress, only some of the API is currently provided.
